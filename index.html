introduction: |
  BRØNN is a doom-infused post-metal band based in Slemmestad and Nesodden, Norway. Drawing inspiration from pioneering acts like Neurosis, Cult of Luna, YOB, and even Pink Floyd, BRØNN creates immersive soundscapes that are as heavy and atmospheric as they are dark and introspective. BRØNN takes listeners on a journey through the shadowy corners of the human psyche, exploring themes of loneliness, anger, and desperation.

  With an entrancing live performance that feels like a journey through deep, emotional voids, BRØNN offers a profound and cathartic experience for listeners who appreciate the marriage of heavy distortion and ethereal sound design. Their music speaks to those who enjoy diving into the darker and more reflective side of metal.

  BRØNNs members are no strangers to the stage. They have years of experience playing across Norway in other projects, with their most notable shows including support for New Zealand’s Spook the Horses and performances with Kambodsja and Forcefed Horsehead. BRØNN continues to build its fan base, attracting crowds of 50-100 passionate metal enthusiasts at each show, both locally and out of town.
